Dataset 1: Titanic Survival Data Description 

This data set contains the survival status of 1309 passengers aboard the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic in 1912 (the ships crew are not included), along with the passengers age, sex and class (which serves as a proxy for economic status). 70% of the data was selected (using stratified sampling) for the training set.

Dataset 2: Income Census Data
This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics). A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1) && (HRSWK>0)). The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over $50K a year.

Dataset 3: COVID Data Set Description
The data (country vaccinations) contains the following information:

Country- this is the country for which the vaccination information is provided;
Country ISO Code - ISO code for the country;
Date - date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total;
Total number of vaccinations - this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country;
Total number of people vaccinated - a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people;
Total number of people fully vaccinated - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme;
Daily vaccinations (raw) - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country;
Daily vaccinations - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country;
Total vaccinations per hundred - ratio (in percent) between vaccination number and total population up to the date in the country;
Total number of people vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population immunized and total population up to the date in the country;
Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population fully immunized and total population up to the date in the country;
Number of vaccinations per day - number of daily vaccination for that day and country;
Daily vaccinations per million - ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date in the country;
Vaccines used in the country - total number of vaccines used in the country (up to date);
Source name - source of the information (national authority, international organization, local organization etc.);
